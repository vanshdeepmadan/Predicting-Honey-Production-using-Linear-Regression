# Predicting-Honey-Production-using-Linear-Regression

Objective

The goal is to analyze honey production data in the United States and build a machine learning model to predict future honey production levels.

Key Components
	1.	Data Analysis:
	•	Load a dataset containing honey production statistics.
	•	Use pandas to inspect the data and identify trends.
	•	Explore key columns like total honey production and average yield.
	2.	Data Visualization:
	•	Use matplotlib to create visualizations such as scatter plots and line graphs.
	•	Identify trends over time (e.g., how honey production has changed in recent years).
	3.	Linear Regression:
	•	Implement a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
	•	Train the model to predict future honey production based on historical data.
	•	Evaluate the model’s accuracy and plot its predictions.
	4.	Future Predictions:
	•	Use the trained model to make predictions for honey production in years not covered by the dataset.

Learning Outcomes
	•	Gain experience in working with real-world datasets.
	•	Practice data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
	•	Learn to implement and evaluate a basic machine learning model.
	•	Understand the use of regression for time-series forecasting.
